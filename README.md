# train_data

Here I have uploaded a folder of the dataset that contains 24864 pictures of cats and dogs that can be used to train a CNN classifier that can classify between images of dogs and cats.

You can directly clone this repo into your whatever platform like <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb">Colab</a>, <a href = "https://www.crestle.com/dashboard">Crestle</a>, <a href = "https://www.paperspace.com/">Paperspace</a> etc. and use it right away.

It contains the same file from the site of Microsoft that can also be downloaded from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765">here</a>.

I have uploaded because I couldn't find it over the github in the first place. There were some truncated versions but not a complete dataset.
